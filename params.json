It allows an individual to use an “OpenSceneGraph-like” toolbox to interact with WebGL via JavaScript, and provides facilities for exporting various assets to the osgjs format. The API is kept as similar to OpenSceneGraph as possible, providing a familiar environment to veterans of the library and introducing newcomers to a popular and heavily-scrutinzed set of interfaces\r\n\r\nThe mailing list is available here: http://groups.google.com/group/osgjs\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in contributing, contact us on the IRC channels #webgl on Freenode, or by e-mail at contact@osgjs.org.

This plugin will help you to export data from osg to osgjs. osgconv \r\n```\r\nextensions : .osgjs                            OpenSceneGraph Javascript implementation format\r\noptions    : disableMergeTriStrip              disable the merge of all tristrip into one\r\noptions    : disableTriStrip                   disable generation of tristrip\r\noptions    : enableWireframe                   create a wireframe geometry for each triangles geometry\r\noptions    : generateTangentSpace              Build tangent space to each geometry\r\noptions    : mergeAllBinaryFiles               merge all binary files into one to avoid multi request on a server\r\noptions    : tangentSpaceTextureUnit=<unit>    Specify on wich texture unit normal map is\r\noptions    : triStripCacheSize=<int>           set the cache size when doing tristrip\r\noptions    : useDrawArray                      prefer drawArray instead of drawelement with split of geometry\r\noptions    : useExternalBinaryArray            create binary files for vertex arrays\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nhttps://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs/tree/master/examples\r\n\r\n","name":"OSG.JS","google":"UA-22680456-2"}
